 *  ------------------------- Abstraction ---------------------------------
 *  # process of hiding implementation details in the program
 *  # To achieve abstraction:
 *   1> Abstract class:
 *       # class which contains abstract(unimplemented) methods and non-abstract
 *       methods is known as abstract class.
 *         # abstract method:
 *             -> method which does not have body/implementation.
 *             e.g.
 *               abstract void print();
 *         # every abstract class must have one child class and must implement abstract
 *         methods.
 *         # we can't create object/instance of abstract class.
 *         # level of abstraction: 0-100%
 *         
 *         #Syntax:
 *           abstract class class_name{
 *           // abstract methods
 *           // non-abstract methods
 *           }
 *    
 *   2> Interface:
 *       # same as class which contains public abstract methods and public static
 *       final variables(constants).
 *       # every interface must have at least one implementation class and impl.class
 *       must implement abstract methods.
 *       # we can't create object of interface.
 *       # level of abstraction 100%.
 *       # multiple inheritance exists in interface but not class.
 *       
 *       #Syntax:
 *           interface interface_name{
 *              // public abstract methods
 *           }
 *
