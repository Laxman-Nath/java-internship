 *  ---------------------------- Inheritance ----------------------------------
 *  # use for code reusability.
 *  # process of accessing properties and methods of parent/base/super class
 *  from child/derived/sub class is known as inheritance.
 *  
 *  # Also known as Is a relationship
 *  # It is generilization to specialization process.
 *  # we can inherit only one class at a time.
 *  # we can't inherit private properties,methods and constructors.
 *  # we can inherit static variables and methods.
 *  # extends keyword is used to inherit .
 *  # Multiple inheritance not supported in class level but it happens in
 *  interface level.
 *  
 *  # Syntax:
 *       child-class extends parent-class{
 *       // properties: parent+child
 *       // methods:parent + child
 *       }
 * 
 * # Example:
 *  class A{
 *  }
 *  class B extends A{
 *  }
 *  class C extends B{
 *  }
 *  class D extends C{
 *  }
